# Derek-Tetris

Code-along practice with the video [JavaScript Tetris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDp8BZbwOqk) by Derek Banas. It is a basic Tetris game made with JavaScript.

Despite displaying a level, the game only has level 1. So a possible improvement could be adding levels, maybe increasing falling speed.

## Oddities

- When rotating the tetromino, it might clip through other blocks.
- The 'I' tetromino rotates in an odd way.
- Sometimes the blocks won't fall down when a row is completed.
- The game over state might happen even if the blocks have not reached the ceiling of the level.
